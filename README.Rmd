# CNASigDetect

CNASigDetect is an R package for detecting and interpreting **copy number alteration (CNA) signatures** from allele-specific segmentation data in tumor genomes.  
It provides tools to:

- Standardize raw segment data into a clean input format.  
- Classify segments into biologically meaningful categories (amplifications, deletions, LOH, neutral events).  
- Summarize CNA patterns at cytoband or chromosome-arm levels.  
- Extract recurrent CNA signatures across samples using unsupervised learning (e.g., NMF).  
- Annotate and visualize signatures for interpretation.  

This package is intended for researchers studying **cancer genomics, tumor evolution, and genomic instability**, offering a reproducible workflow for CNA signature discovery.
